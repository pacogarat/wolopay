            Shops are a way to show a different configuration of Articles, prices, offers, etc... depending on a "categorization" of users.
            Wolopay allows by default to categorize your users into "rookies", "common" and "expert". You could choose tho shop cheap products and offers to rookies, maybe trying that they pay by SMS as a way to break the entry barrier; at the same time, you could show more expresive packs to the "medium" users making offers if they pay by VISA, and the most advanced and expensive products to expert users.

            Shops represennt the existing "groups". During integration time, the way of indicating how to categorize users will be decided.
